A Media Monetisation Network using Lisk Protocol
================================================

# Problem
- Lack of traceability in the international print media
- Excess of centralisation in the regional print media
- Lack of interoperability between print media networks
- Limited scalability for print media messaging systems

# Solution
- Time Tokenisation of print media content
- Conversion of print media into non fungible tokens

# Technology
- Lisk SDK
- Lisk Sidechains
- NPM
- NodeJS

# Roadmap
- Integration of Zero Knowledge Proofs
- Integration of Verifiable Delay Functions
- Implementation of Time Tokens using Lisk Protocols
- Implementation of Non Fungible Tokens on Lisk Protocols
